========================================
Pipe - simple
========================================

printf "one" | echo

---

(program
    (pipe
        (command
            name: (variable_name)
            argument: (double_quote_string))
        (command
            name: (variable_name))))

========================================
Pipe - with redirection
========================================

false | printf > file
echo 1 >&0 | echo

---

(program
    (pipe
        (command name: (variable_name))
        (redirected_statement
            (command name: (variable_name))
            (file_redirect
                operator: (direction)
                destination: (variable_name))))
    (pipe
        (redirected_statement
            (command
                name: (variable_name)
                argument: (variable_name))
            (stream_redirect))
        (command name: (variable_name))))


========================================
Pipe - with conditional execution
========================================

false || printf | file
echo | echo || echo

---

(program
    (conditional_execution
        (command name: (variable_name))
        (pipe
            (command name: (variable_name))
            (command name: (variable_name))))
    (conditional_execution
        (pipe
            (command name: (variable_name))
            (command name: (variable_name)))
        (command name: (variable_name))))
